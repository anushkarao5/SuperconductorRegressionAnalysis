    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Number of elements:</strong> Number of elements in the chemical formula of the superconductor
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Atomic mass:</strong> The mass of an individual atom of the element, accounting for the various isotopes of the element and their relative abundance
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>FIE (first ionization energy):</strong> Energy required to remove the outermost (most loosely held) electron from a neutral atom in its gaseous state
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Atomic radius:</strong> Distance from the nucleus of an atom to the outermost orbital of its electron
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Density:</strong> The degree of compactness of a substance. How closely packed the particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) of a substance are within a given volume
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Electron affinity:</strong> The neutral atom's likelihood of gaining an electron.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Fusion heat:</strong> Amount of heat needed to change a substance from a solid state to its liquid state while maintaining constant temperature and pressure
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Thermal conductivity:</strong> The material's ability to conduct heat. How efficiently a material can transfer heat from one point to another
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Valence:</strong> The combining power of an element, measured by the number of hydrogen atoms an element can displace or combine with.
